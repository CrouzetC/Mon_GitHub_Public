Here is a Python program that simulates the creation of visual patters (stains, lines,...) similar to some animal's coats
(Alan Turing introduced this method in the article "The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis").

It can simply be launched in a terminal using "python3 morphogenesis.py" (you may get errors using PythonX where X < 3).

The librairies matplotlib and numpy must be installed.
