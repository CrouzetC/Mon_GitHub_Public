You will find in this repository several directories, each one contains one or several little projects.

They are totally independant, so each directory has its own README.

The most interesting project in terme of computer engineering is in the directory "Simulation", it is supposed to be a very simple simulation of a particle's wavepacket (e.g. an electron).
